<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">In the preceding chapter I remarked on psychologists’ belief that language acts as a barrier to creativity. Creative thinking requires that the thinker retreat from symbolic thought to a more basic mode of cognition that is more nearly visual than verbal. Symbolic thought by its nature predisposes one to consider problems in existing categories. We benefit enormously in our day-to-day lives from this ability to cast reality in familiar terms and manipulate knowledge structures through a directory of pointers. At the same time, these structures inhibit us from “visualizing” data in new ways. Recurrent neural activation patterns, literally models of our past successes, do not yield easily to reformation. Designating these constructs with verbal markers validates their status as units, strengthening their resistance to change.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">We shall consider this problem in detail in a later chapter. Our task now is to demonstrate how writing—a representation of language—facilitates creativity by helping people overcome their conceptual biases as speakers of a symbolic language. More to the point, how can writing, which is believed to have a conservative influence on language, act as a catalyst for radical thought? To answer these questions we must be more specific about how language, writing, and speech interact and about how these mechanisms relate to the way we think.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">In essence there are two conflicting interpretations of how writing maps onto language. One theory, associated with the views of American linguist Leonard Bloomfield (1933) and the early behaviorist school of psychology, holds that language literally </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> speech and that no legitimate distinction can be made between the abstract knowledge that generates a linguistic expression and the concrete speech act itself. In this view, writing acts as a secondary system—its units are symbols of symbols. As Scinto (1986:1) put it, “Traditional accounts of the nature of language have viewed written language as a derivative symbol system, one that enjoys only a parasitic status with respect to oral language.” Scholars who support this older view cite the ontogenetic and phylogenetic priority of speech as their basis for identifying speech with language, and the fact that all writing is to a greater or lesser degree based on phonology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">A newer interpretation is that writing and speech each </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">manifest</span><span class="font5"> structures generated through the body of rules that make up a language. Instead of “representing” speech, writing and speech are both viewed as parallel expressions of language—in Scinto’s words, “as equipollent systems that equally manifest man’s linguistic capacity” (2). Transformational rules produce a string of elements from a deep, abstract representation of the thoughts one wishes to convey. These elements are then realized orally through speech or visually through writing. Although the units of writing ideally bear a relationship with those of speech, it is less important that one be specified in terms of the other than that the units of both media be adapted to the practical tasks with which they are associated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">This modern view of writing and speech as alternative expressions of language arose more or less independently among scholars on different continents engaged in a variety of disciplines. In Europe, the debate had never been whether writing represents speech or language but whether writing and speech represent even the same language (Amirova 1977:5, 35; 1985:4). Eastern European scholars in particular were under no compulsion to tailor their research to American intellectual paradigms and as a consequence produced many innovative ideas on the relationship between language, writing, and human psychology, some of which we shall touch on below.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">In the United States, Bloomfield’s structuralism was eclipsed in the early 1960s by generative grammar, which rejected the behaviorist tenets on which this older view of language was based. Unlike the structuralists, who excluded higher cognitive functions from the study of language, the newer school of linguists embraced them, regarding abstract, objectified language— language that more closely resembles polished texts than speech—as the foundation of linguistic science. Instead of looking at language from the bottom up, the younger linguists studied language, if not from the top down, then at least in terms of models that seek to explain mental processes. Even phonology, the most concrete part of the linguistic hierarchy, was shown to depend on abstract manipulations and on “units” that have no direct analogue in speech. With the focus on generative forms, it was immaterial whether the content of these forms was sounds or written symbols.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Adherents to Bloomfield’s views on writing, fixated on the apparent fact that speech preceded writing in the evolution of human societies, also failed to take into account some clues about the nature of writing that were evident in the evolution of their own discipline. As I shall note presently, awareness of language—the whole of it and its particular structures— became possible only with the appearance of writing. Prior to that, language and speech </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font5"> indistinguishable, and remain so today in preliterate minds, because no alternative way to express language existed. What was true of language in general was also true of its components, including those at the lower end of the scale where the structuralists felt most at home. Although not a fact that they were prone to dwell on, the concept of phonemes, which is where the structuralists did some of their best work, was derived from alphabetic orthography, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Setting aside the issue of primacy, which has less to do with the relationship between writing and speech than with the philosophical choices of individual scholars, and looking at the relationship from a functional perspective, it has long been apparent that writing and speech use separate neurological channels. For example, the notion that reading involves translating written symbols into sound and then listening to one’s own inner speech—a legacy of the structuralist paradigm—has been discredited in a dozen different ways (Hannas 1997:153-58). Although phonological recoding </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font5"> be used by readers to access lexical items, it is neither the only nor even the preferred route.<sup>2</sup> The functional independence of speech and writing is further demonstrated in neurolinguistic studies showing that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">either</span><span class="font5"> speech </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font5"> reading can be selectively impaired, and that disorders in the one area do not correlate with disorders in the other (Paradis et al. 1985).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Given the overwhelming evidence that language is not a synonym for speech, and that writing, like speech, has a semiautonomous relationship with the structures that make up language, the important questions to ask pertain not to the relationship between the two media, which has largely been decided, but to the psychology of those holding such negative views about writing. Why was writing neglected by American linguists? And why do a few academics insist even today that writing is a secondary phenomenon whose significance is overstated absolutely and relative to speech?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">These are not trivial questions. As we shall see, sensitivity over the status of writing reflects deep-seated differences in attitudes toward scholarship and society. Moreover, the failure to recognize writing’s full role in human cognitive development has unnecessarily delayed the integration of promising lines of research in multiple disciplines. It has, for example, inhibited the exploration of links between writing systems and culture and frustrated the articulation of conclusions “intuitively and tentatively reached by many scientists” about the effect of writing on the historical development of thought (de Kerckhove 1988:417).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">At first I thought the problem stemmed from the conditions surrounding the rise of linguistics in the United States. On the one hand, the early linguists’ studies of Native American languages, which were mostly unwritten, prejudiced them against writing. Although this may have been one reason for their neglect, it could not have been decisive, since similar conditions in the Soviet Union failed to generate the same antipathy. On the other hand, linguists’ eagerness to found their discipline on a scientific basis more or less guaranteed that they would try to explain their data in terms of the era’s leading paradigm: hard core reductionism. Following the lead of psychologists, linguists sought to reduce language to its most concrete observable elements—the sounds of speech—and were less interested in higher structures not amenable to a mechanistic approach, such as those typically reflected in writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">This latter explanation rings true, given that the direct hostility toward writing mostly vanished when linguists replaced their reductionist model with one able to accommodate what the structuralists had disparaged as mental phenomena. The paradigm shift that began with the demise of billiard ball mechanics in physics wound its way through the social sciences and humanities, where it should never have been applied, resulting in a new willingness by linguists to investigate data whose cognitive antecedents were not directly apparent. The inability of a few language scholars to make this transition has had no consequence for linguistics overall, although their nuisance effect is still felt in the less commonly taught languages, which are more shielded from academic scrutiny.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Recently I have come to believe that other factors contributed to this tendency to marginalize writing. Linguists were forced to acknowledge writing’s role as a direct expression of language by the logic of their own theory of grammar. Nonetheless, complaints can still be heard among some linguists, including generative grammarians responsible for the new view of language, about the unnaturalness of reading and writing. People learn to speak almost effortlessly, it is argued, whereas literacy is acquired only through a deliberate effort, and often not at all. If writing is a part of language, why is it so hard to learn?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Another sign of lingering resentment toward writing is the humanities’ current fondness of so-called “oral societies.” This term seemed ludicrous to me at first because it suggests that preliterate societies have found their own path to communication equal in value to that of literate societies, and indeed this is often the message intended. So if oral societies do not read and write, then literate societies cannot hear and speak? And what can “equal” possibly mean when survival itself depends nowadays on leveraging the artifacts of literate culture? It is not hard to poke holes in the logic of these assumptions, as Goody and Watt were already doing three decades ago with their complaint about the “sentimental egalitarianism” that compares oral societies favorably with those that read and write (1968:67).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">While I have little sympathy for this approach to “solving” literacy problems by denying its value, my research on creativity has convinced me that the categorical notion of an oral society is valid, inasmuch as it conveys much more than the absence of a particular skill. It reflects a unique mindset, as different from the literate mindset as orality is from the absence of language altogether. Moreover, I will go as far as to endorse the term “semioral society,” for reasons that I shall get into later, to describe societies not necessarily with low literacy rates but whose particular type of literacy inhibits its members from acquiring the full range of cognitive benefits potentially available through literacy. This view no doubt will be criticized as “elitist,” as are the views of most scholars who have explored the implications of writing, but I think the issue is important enough to risk censure from some quarters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">And if, despite my first impression, oral society does mean more than a lack of literacy, I will also concede the one good argument the language-as-speech group has been able to make, namely, the unnaturalness of writing. Writing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> unnatural, not because of its mechanics,'<sup>5</sup> nor even because it has existed too briefly to have spawned a heritable acquisition device such as that supposedly available for speech. Learning to read and write is difficult because it involves exercising the unnatural skills of analysis and abstraction. Literacy presupposes an ability to recognize, on some level, that language is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> speech. This major feat of abstraction, that even literate people sometimes are unable consciously to achieve, opens one’s mind to the power of abstraction generally, laying the basis for introspection, creativity, and self-consciousness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">This latter point has been made by other scholars with respect both to writing as a whole and to its individual components (the notion of the phoneme). I mention it here to demonstrate that if language were speech, and writing were a representation of speech, none of this unnaturalness would be felt. People would simply map the one system of signs onto the other, without the conceptual frustration typically experienced in becoming literate. Nor would the cognitive differences between oral and literate societies be as great as researchers have found them to be.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Writing and Abstract Thought</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">Linguists’ reluctance to treat writing as a part of language had ramifications in other areas. As Wrolstad pointed out, their neglect made it easier for sociologists and cultural anthropologists to downplay writing’s cognitive role and to minimize the differences between literate and illiterate societies (1976:35). Instead of focusing on the psycholinguistic distinctions between the two types of cultures, scholars spent far too much time extolling the “complexity” of oral languages, that is, those without writing, as if complexity itself were the core issue. This spirit pervades linguistics even today, evidenced by its dictum that “there are no primitive languages,” and continues to deflect scholarship from the main problem, as I see it, of why people in oral societies </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">think</span><span class="font5"> differently.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">What are these differences between oral and literate thought? We noted that writing is difficult to learn because it serves as an early exemplar of the difference between an abstract entity and its concrete representation. Writing objectifies language, distancing what is said from the person who said it and the particular circumstances that accompany an utterance. It causes one to focus on the meaning of a discourse regardless of what it seemed to mean when it was first presented. For a written text to be understood, the reader must provide a context metaphorically distant from what the reader qua hearer would recognize through an oral exchange. Learning how to do this is a wrenching experience, but at the same time one that frees the mind from its dependence on the here and now, not just in language but in the exercise of thought generally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Oral societies spare their members this trauma at the expense of miring their thinking in concrete events. As Ong noted, “A sound-dominated verbal economy is consonant with aggregative (harmonizing) tendencies rather than with analytic, dissecting tendencies.” It fosters situational thinking “rather than abstract thinking” and a mindset that is “more communal and externalized, and less introspective than [that] common among literates. Oral communication unites people in groups. Writing and reading are solitary activities that throw the psyche back on itself” (1982:69, 73). Ong attributes these differences in thinking to the technology of writing, without which “the literate mind would not and could not think as it does” (78).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Donald in his classic study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Origins of the Modern Mind</span><span class="font5"> observes similarly “the major products of analytic thought . . . are generally absent from purely mythic cultures. A partial list of features that are absent include formal arguments, systematic taxonomies, induction, deduction, verification, differentiation, quantification, idealization, and formal methods of measurement” (1991:273). Donald attributes “the switch from a predominantly narrative mode of thought to a predominantly theoretic mode” to what he calls “a shift in the relative importance of the two major distal-perceptual modalities, from auditory to visual representation.” Summarizing the differences between the two types of cultures, he states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">There are two broadly different modes of thinking evident in modern humans. One is sometimes called narrative thought, and the other is variously called analytic, paradigmatic, or logico-scientific. In modern culture, narrative thought is dominant in the literary arts, while analytic thought predominates in science, law and government. The narrative or mythic dimension of modern culture has been expressed in print, but it is well to keep in mind that in its inception, mythic thought did not depend upon print or visual symbolism; it was an extension, in its basic form, of the oral narrative. (273)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Scholes and Willis (1991), whose work on phoneme perception I discuss later, observed the same cognitive differences between nonliterate and literate people that Donald and others claim exist between oral and literate societies. According to the two scholars, nonliterates have difficulty with analogies and “appear unable to classify things on the basis of geometrical categories or other abstract properties. Nonliterate adults employ, we would suggest, the same concrete operational processing as preliterate children.” In their view, “the handicap of illiteracy is far more profound than is suggested by the inability to read. Illiteracy is more accurately seen as a complex of linguistic and cognitive competencies qualitatively unlike those of literates” (228-30).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">David Olson, who has thought about the cognitive impact of writing on traditional oral societies more than anyone, believes that writing “split the comprehensive process into two parts, that part preserved by the text, the given, and that part, the interpretation, provided by the reader” (1986:318). Writing forces a distinction between what one thinks a text means and what is actually in the text, the former being subjective and concrete bound, the latter being objective and abstract. This distinction carries over into thought generally, providing what Olson calls “the model, more than that, the precise cognitive categories or concepts needed for the description and the interpretation of nature; that is, for the building of modern science” (304).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Derrick de Kerckhove has also written extensively about the relationship between writing and cognition. In his view, “Oral languages are always, of necessity, ‘contextualized.’ Their usage is both field- and context-dependent. Even at their metaphorical best, they remain grounded in biological needs. Under such conditions, discoveries and innovations made possible by direct, oral communication can never stray too far away from the need to respond to established environmental (or situational) conditioning” (1988:107). Abstract thought, which we identified earlier as the sine qua non of scientific creativity, is a function of the literate mind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">The transition from context-bound situational thinking to abstract, analytical thinking that occurs when individuals become literate represents the achievement on a personal level of what some cognitive scientists now recognize as the most recent stage in the development of thought. We noted above Donald’s description of “mythic” (essentially oral) and “theoretic” (literate) cultures, characterized respectively by concrete and abstract modes of thinking. The cultures are the last two of four evolutionary stages Donald identifies, each based on changes in the representational structure of thought (1991:274). The first stage of “episodic” thinking is the most basic form of cognition, which focuses on discrete events of limited duration; there is no modeling of relations between events. “Mimetic” thought, which succeeds it, depends on the representation of features that transcend specific events. Sophisticated modeling of environmental inputs enables mimetic cultures to achieve skill levels adequate for tool making and many types of advanced communal activities despite the absence of language. Symbolic thought, a function of oral language, underlies Donald’s third stage of “mythic” thinking, characterized by the advent of conceptual knowledge and pragmatic technologies. Abstract thought is the basis for the final stage, which Donald calls “theoretic” or scientific culture (334-35).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">These stages are cumulative. That is, earlier forms of representation provide the foundation for more advanced forms. Successive cultures continue to use the earlier modes of cognition where appropriate. What changes, beyond physical accretions to the brain’s structure, is the way the brain models the world. As Donald notes, “The key word here is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">representation.</span><span class="font5"> Humans did not simply evolve a larger brain, an expanded memory, a lexicon, or a special speech apparatus; we evolved new systems for representing reality” (3).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Donald’s emphasis on representation as the main factor in cognitive evolution is consistent with Terrence Deacon’s views on the progress of thought discussed in the preceding chapter. Deacon identifies three categories of semiotic relationships—iconic, indexical, and symbolic—that the brain learned to model in the course of its development. Iconic relationships, in which a part of a stimulus is used to represent an object or event, correlate with Donald’s episodic thought. These icons form the basis for indices that model relationships between events, corresponding to the mimetic thinking that makes up Donald’s second stage. Symbolic representation is the third stage of cognitive evolution in both of their systems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Donald, however, goes on to make a qualitative distinction between the two major classes of symbols, verbal and written, based on the distinctive modes of consciousness associated with them. Interestingly, many of the stereotypes he identifies with oral and literate cognitive styles parallel the dichotomies between right- and left-brain thinking that we described earlier. This suggests that writing may be at least partly responsible for the lateralization of language’s more analytic functions to the left hemisphere.<sup>4 </sup>Jaynes also identified two distinct types of human consciousness, one concrete and reactive, the other abstract and introspective. He linked the shift from the former to the latter type with a change in the physical locus of symbolic thought, which he believed was shared equally between the brain’s two halves (bicamerality) but which later came to be directed primarily by the left hemisphere. Writing, in his view, served as a catalyst to promote this shift (1976:208, 302).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Walter Ong argued that writing did not just promote the changes Jaynes described; rather, it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">embodied</span><span class="font5"> them. Ong states, “the early and late stages of consciousness which Julian Jaynes (1976) describes and relates to neurophysical changes in the bicameral mind would also appear to lend themselves largely to much simpler and more verifiable description in terms of a shift from orality to literacy” (1982:29). The shift from the diffuse consciousness characteristic of Jaynes’s bicameral and Donald’s mythic culture to the focused, egocentric self-consciousness of modern theoretic culture was, to use a contemporary analogy, embedded in the software of writing. As Ong put it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">Whatever one makes of Jaynes’s theories one cannot but be struck by the resemblance between the characteristics of the early “bicameral” psyche as Jaynes describes it—lack of introspectivity, of analytical prowess, of concern with the will as such, of a sense of difference between past and future—and the characteristics of the psyche in oral cultures not only in the past but even today. The effects of oral states of consciousness are bizarre to the literate mind, and they can invite elaborate explanations which may turn out to be needless. Bicamerality may simply mean orality. (30)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Russian psychologists were among the first to describe the parallel between the acquisition of literacy and a change in the dominant mode of thinking from concrete to abstract. Experiments conducted by A. R. Luria (1976) with preliterate and literate farmers showed gross differences in the way objects were viewed (holistically or analytically), and in the ability to identify abstract relationships. Luria also found nonliterates focusing on the pragmatic aspects of problems (the how) while literate people were more interested in their theoretical aspects (the why). Luria concluded, “cognitive processes change qualitatively, as a result of literacy, and in changing they radically alter our perceptions of reality.”<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Lev S. Vygotsky’s work with schoolchildren led him to the same conclusions. Observing the time lag between the onset of speech and a child’s acquisition of writing, Vygotsky rejected the notion that the delay had anything to do with the need to relearn language. Writing takes more time to learn, he argued, because it is associated with a “high level of abstraction” for which speech provides no antecedent (1962:98-99). He further maintained, “when an individual comes to master writing, the basic system underlying the nature of his mental processes is changed fundamentally as the external symbol system comes to mediate the organization of all his basic intellectual operations.”<sup>6</sup> Instruction in a given area “influences the development of the higher functions far beyond the confines of that particular subject,” making writing and abstract thought inseparable (102).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Western scholars who investigated writing and culture have also argued for a direct relationship between literacy and abstract thought. H. Innis wrote in 1950 that writing caused people to apply “their minds to symbols rather than things. . . . Writing enormously enhanced a capacity for abstract thinking which had been evident in the growth of language in the oral tradition.”<sup>7</sup> Goody and Watt (1968:44) believed writing established “a different kind of relationship between the word and its referent, a relationship that is more general and more abstract, and less closely connected with the particularities of person, place and time that obtains in oral communication.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">George Miller summarized the results of a famous conference held in 1972 on the relationship between speech, learning, and reading by noting, “the written proposition is a tangible representation of an act of thought. It is a physical thing, an object, and it can be reacted to as any other object can. Thus writing made it possible to react to one’s own thoughts as if they were objects, so the act of thought became itself a subject for further thought. Thus extended abstraction became possible” (374).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Merald Wrolstad in his 1976 article “A Manifesto for Visible Language” captured what writing experts felt about linguists’ neglect of writing and the effect of this neglect on the understanding of cognitive development. He also added an interesting argument to the data linking writing to abstract thought by noting that “symbolization involves first a process of abstraction; the starting point is something to abstract from. The advantage visible symbols have from the start is that their roots lie in representation. . . . Audible signs are almost totally arbitrary from the beginning” (32).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">The link between writing and abstract thought was taken up by Ong in 1982, who argued “All thought, including that in primary oral cultures, is to some degree analytic: it breaks its materials into various components. But abstractly sequential, classificatory, explanatory examination of phenomena or of stated truths is impossible without writing and reading” (8). All conceptual thinking is abstract, but “oral cultures tend to use concepts in situational, operational frames of reference that are minimally abstract” (49). David Olson expanded his earlier theory* that writing forces a distinction between concrete form and abstract content in his 1994 book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The World on Paper,</span><span class="font5"> where he attributed the awareness of ideas and scientific development to the abstract mindset caused by writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Brian Stock, who studied literacy’s impact on medieval thought, reached the same conclusion about writing and abstract thinking. “A distinction likewise arose between the content of what was perceived and the status in reality assigned to it by the process of sifting, classifying, and encoding. . . . Sets of rules, that is, codes generated from written discourse, were employed not only to produce new behavioral patterns but to restructure existing ones.” Stock believed that “literacy, as it actually penetrated medieval life and thought, brought about a transformation of the basic skills of reading and writing into instruments of analysis and interpretation” (1983:11).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Such are the effects of writing. Abstraction. Analytic thinking. The birth of formal knowledge and founding of science. Pretty fair achievements for “mere symbols of symbols.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">Literacy promotes abstract thinking by making one aware of a hidden structure conceptually distinct from the concrete elements that embody it. Absent writing, people cannot formally distinguish language from the sounds through which it operates. By providing an alternative to speech, writing draws attention to its abstract antecedent in several ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">First, since written language shares some but not all the mechanisms used in speech, a contrast is set up between the part of language that disappears—concrete sounds—and the remainder of language that writing utilizes. An unitary process is found to be composed of separable parts. Second, each of the two media, sharing a common focus, is perceived to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">standing for</span><span class="font5"> the same thing. The discovery that an entity can be used to represent something else introduces one to the availability of abstraction as a cognitive tool. Third, since the units of speech and writing cannot, for historical and pragmatic reasons, be derived from each other, linking the two must be done on an abstract level that is beyond direct observation. Mediating the relationship between the two types of units acclimates one to dealing with abstract associations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">These arguments concern the language mechanism itself. Other scholars have applied the same type of argument to the content of language. As noted in the preceding section, writing enables us to separate what is said from the concrete trappings of oral communication. It externalizes a message, exposing its information to objective analysis. The effect operates on literate persons as readers, and also in their capacity as writers by reminding them of the difference between what they thought they wrote and how the text actually appears a day or two later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">It is difficult for literate people to appreciate the effect literacy has on thought because we take for granted the cognitive style associated with literacy. I personally had a hard time accepting the arguments made by Olson, Ong, and others not because of any flaw in the logic or lack of empirical evidence, but simply because I could not duplicate in my head the preliterate state of mind they described. Most of us (except physicists and all software developers) try to ground theory and long chains of logic in familiar terms to guard against flights of fancy. Although the argument for a cognitive gap between literate and preliterate thought is persuasive, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">feeling</span><span class="font5"> the difference is another matter entirely. Apparently it takes an act of abstraction to appreciate life without abstraction. Explaining this issue has also been a bit of a chore and I suspect the reason is the difficulty one has finding metaphors to describe a cognitive transformation so basic that it seems to preempt their use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">If writing encourages abstract thought, then it stands to reason that the more abstract a writing system is, the more strongly it influences the development of abstract thinking. This thesis has been entertained by scholars with backgrounds as different as Arthur Koestler and Ovid Tzeng. In Koestler’s view, conceptual thought emerged with the development of abstract symbolization from an earlier stage where thinking was done in images. This process was supported by the evolution of writing as it developed from pictographs to higher levels of abstraction (1964:173). Tzeng and Hung (1988:275) note that</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">the evolution of writing seems to have taken a single direction: at every advance, the number of symbols in the script decreases, and as a direct consequence the abstractness of the relation between script and meaning increases and the link between graphemes and phonemes becomes clearer. This pattern of development seems to parallel the general trend of cognitive development in children and thus may have important implications for beginning readers of different orthographies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Writing in both China and the West began by depicting the physical characteristics of certain objects. The written symbols used by the Sumerians in the fourth millennium B.c., and by the ancestors of the Chinese a thousand years later, originally had no connection with the sounds of language, or with natural language at all. They were icons of particular phenomena, which later came to represent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">classes</span><span class="font5"> of objects. This shift from concrete objects to referents of greater abstraction was accompanied by stylization of the symbols themselves. As the particular nature of the symbols disappeared, they began to be associated with words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">With the primary association between written symbol and object replaced by a direct link between the symbol and a word, writers were able to represent words for which no written symbols existed by using symbols for other words that had the same sound. Instead of inventing a new form that mimicked the physical characteristics of its referent—a task complicated by the abstract nature of many referents—existing graphs were used for their phonetic value alone. This practice eliminated any </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font5"> connection between the symbols and the phenomena they represented, raising the level of abstraction a notch higher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Writing thus came to identify sound (and morphemes to the extent that different graphs were used for the same sound). However, the sounds represented were syllables. No attempt was made, either in China or initially in the West, to identify subsyllabic segments. The connection between symbol and sound was holistic, not analytic. What abstraction did occur was of the sort described above that applies to literacy in general. The major analytical step of identify ing and symbolizing phonemes, as depicted in the alphabet, remained to be taken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Ancient Greece is popularly regarded as the first civilization to use phonemic writing, but this notion is misleading. The alphabet evolved incrementally, its development having begun many centuries before the Greeks made their contribution. By 1400 </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font5"> Semitic people in the Middle East were using a default alphabet based on twenty-four symbols distilled earlier by the Egyptians from hieroglyphs to represent the language’s most common syllables. Over time the Semites learned to ignore the vocalic aspect of the syllables and treat the graphs </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">as if</span><span class="font5"> they represented only the initial consonant phonemes. As Lafont (1988:93) noted, “The true significance of the Canaanite invention was not the leap from syllabic to phonemic representation, but from a fully syllabic system to one in which the vocalic part was not differentiated within the syllable.” Since the roots of Semitic languages depend more critically on consonants than vowels, it was sufficient to depict only the consonants and let the reader supply the vowels from context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">The consonantal alphabet, derivatives of which are in use today, differed from all previous systems by its de facto representation of phonemes. According to Goody, the traditional view, held by the Greeks themselves, is that the Greek alphabet is an adaptation of Phoenician (another Semitic group) consonantal writing and dates from the eighth century B.c. Another view holds that it originated in the eleventh century B.c. and was descended, like Old Phoenician, from Canaanite writing (1987:46-47). In any case, what the Greeks apparently did was reassign four symbols used for Semitic consonants that the Greek language lacked to represent Greek vowels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Even here it seems likely that the Greeks backed into their “invention.” Vowels were depicted occasionally by the Phoenicians with supplementary signs added to the consonant orthography. As Bolinger described it, the Greeks simply did “consistently what the Phoenicians had done sporadically: to add the interpretative vowel signs to all their syllables. What they themselves must have regarded still as a syllabary thus became an alphabet by accident” (1968:170). The phonemic alphabet was not founded deliberately through a creative cognitive process. Rather it resulted from a series of adaptations, each leading to a higher level of abstraction. The Greeks did not invent an alphabet because they were good at abstract thought; they became good at abstract thought because they were the first to use a full alphabet.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">The Greeks were also first to develop abstract modern science, perhaps the only civilization to do so indigenously.<sup>10</sup> As Robert Logan, author of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Alphabet Effect,</span><span class="font5"> has noted, the science practiced in China was “phenomenological, not abstract, and concerned with practical questions. It was based exclusively on observation and not on some theoretical foundation” (1986:22). It remained for the Greeks to give science logical and analytical characteristics, a feat that Logan attributes to the cognitive effects on Greek thought of a fully phonemic alphabet. China failed to develop abstract science because it had no fully phonetic system of writing. Without this tool, China lacked the cognitive model to transform practical science into an abstract discipline.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Logan’s thesis as it applies to China has been criticized by DeFrancis and others for its mistaken claim that Chinese writing is “ideographic.” As DeFrancis (1984:133-48) and I (1997:104-9) both noted, there is no writing system—in China or anywhere in the world—that directly encodes thought. All writing encodes language, and thought only through language. Chinese characters are no exception. Like every other orthography, it is based largely on phonetic principles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">That said, it seems unfair to blame Logan, who is not an Asia specialist, for accepting the notion that Chinese writing is idea-based, since this misconception was caused by Sinologists (it is still perpetuated by many of that same group, although mercifully not by those trained in linguistics). Moreover, Logan’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">instincts</span><span class="font5"> about Chinese writing and the ill effect it has on science were right on track. As we shall see, Chinese writing, though based on sound, fails critically to extend its analysis of sound beyond naturally occurring syllables. It functions, phonetically at least, as a large syllabary, so that in linguistic terms its development stopped at a level reached in the West more than 3,000 years ago, before the fractionalization of syllables into phonemes had begun.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Although Logan’s argument for a connection between Asian writing and concrete thought requires some adjustment, his thesis about a link between the alphabet and abstract science has widespread support. Goody and Watt argued that the Greeks developed unique skills in logic and scientific classification through their use of the alphabet. They noted that Plato himself in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theaetetus</span><span class="font5"> “compares the process of reasoning to the combination of irreducible elements or letters of the alphabet into syllables which, unlike their constituent letters, have meaning” (1968:52-54). Goody later wrote “there are clearly some links between the general growth of science and the growth in the development of more abstract writing systems” (1987:65).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Eric Havelock in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Literate Revolution in Greece and Its Cultural Consequences</span><span class="font5"> called the alphabet “a piece of explosive technology, revolutionary in its effects on human culture, in a way not precisely shared by any other invention. . . . [It] furnished a necessary conceptual foundation on which to build the structure of the modern sciences and philosophies” (1982:6). Havelock reiterated his argument in an essay titled “The Oral-Literate Equation: A Formula for the Modern Mind,” where he argued for a direct, causal connection between the Greek alphabet and modern scientific thought (1991:24).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Others such as Donald credit ancient Greece as being “the birthplace of theoretic civilization” where “all the essential symbolic inventions were in place for the first time.” However, Donald backs off from Logan’s view that the alphabet caused this transformation because, as he put it, “phonetic scripts, in the form of various syllabaries, had been in existence for almost 2000 years” (1991:340-41). The psycholinguist M. Martin Taylor concedes, “the development of the Greek alphabet coincided with the development of logical modes of philosophical thought” but adds that this “temporal coincidence could have been causally related; but it is hard to imagine how such a relation could ever be proved” (1988:356). Findlay and Lumsden state “a correlation between rates of innovation and degree of alphabetization is not of itself sufficient to demonstrate a causal link or ‘adaptive’ connection between the two” (1988:168).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">This skepticism is reasonable and needs to be addressed. I shall try to show in the remainder of this chapter that there is indeed a causal relationship between use of a fully phonemic alphabet and the development of modern scientific thought. I will also describe how this relationship figures into the creative process.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Alphabet as a Cognitive Facilitator</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">In the preceding chapter I identified four (possibly five) stages of scientific creativity, namely, preparation, incubation, inspiration, verification (and communicating results). The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">preparation</span><span class="font5"> stage involves subjecting to critical analysis a problem that defies conventional solutions until the problem is reduced to its constituents. Unlike innovation, where changes are additive, creativity requires that existing structures be reconfigured to accommodate data inconsistent with the received paradigm. Deconstructing these concepts into their abstract antecedents is the necessary first step.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Incubation</span><span class="font5">—creativity’s second stage—differs radically from the first stage in being beyond one’s conscious control. Abstract elements generated by logical processes seek models from one’s store of source representations to guide their reconstruction. In contrast to the focused approach needed during preparation, incubation requires a relaxation of top-down constraints so that opportunities to access novel source models are maximized. The process is identified with the brain’s right hemisphere, with its denser connectivity and parallel style of information processing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">A third stage of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">insight</span><span class="font5"> occurs when a new synthesis is achieved between the target data and a source model. The subjective feeling of something coming together is a function of this pairing of data from two disparate realms. The new structure is subjected to a critical analysis by left hemispheric processes meant to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">validate</span><span class="font5"> the synthesis. Both of these latter stages—insight and verification—depend on one’s ability to lateralize data from one hemisphere to the other and to coordinate discrete and diffuse modes of processing. Finally, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">communicating</span><span class="font5"> the discovery to an audience of peers is facilitated or inhibited by the willingness of the culture to accept novelty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Each of these stages, I submit, presupposes cognitive skills that are developed or reinforced by alphabetic literacy. In fact, the two sets of skills correspond so well that it is tempting to regard the alphabet as more than a facilitator of creativity. Rather, it is a model of the act itself. Let’s look first at the alphabet’s contributions to creativity’s preparatory stage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">There can be no question that the alphabet plays a leading role in the development of analytic thought. Historically writing begins with the iconic representation of physical phenomena and proceeds through various stages where the link with language intensifies, until its units become identified with syllables, at which point development usually halts. This pattern is observed in cultures that founded writing indigenously (Sumerian, Mayan, and presumably Chinese) or assimilated the concept and early prototypes from other civilizations (Japanese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">kana,</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pce-hangul</span><span class="font5"> Korean syllabaries, Vietnamese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">chu nom,</span><span class="font5"> and some West African and Native American systems). The evolution typically stops when a language’s syllables each have holistic representations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Moving beyond syllables to subsyllabic segments is difficult both for individuals learning an alphabet and for nonalphabetic cultures in general. The difficulty is exemplified by the historical tendency of writing to end its development at the syllable stage, and in the cognitive problems young readers have learning phonemic abstractions that correspond to nothing in the concrete world. Alphabetic literacy requires that one learn to dissect whole units into their intangible constituents, manipulate these abstract entities, and identify specific instances of sound (allophones) as members of abstract classes (phonemes) on the basis of shared features.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">These skills bear directly on operations used in creativity’s analytic or preparatory stage. James (1890:507) in describing this stage identified a phenomenon that most of us in the alphabetic tradition take for granted, but that is central to the ability to perform analysis. In James’s words, “Why the repetition of the character in combination with different wholes will cause it thus to break up its adhesion with any one of them, and roll out, as it were, alone upon the table of consciousness, is a little of a mystery.” The act of isolating a common element from the concrete environments where it resides, however, is exactly what is required of alphabet users when they learn to identify abstract phonemes within the syllables that embody them. As Scholes and Willis note,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">Phonemes are intensional. Dividing the continuum of speech into discreet, sublexi-cal, subsyllabic units involves using mental constructs that have no reality in the physical world. The reference of any phoneme is its function in the phonemic system in which it obtains; a phoneme is, by definition, not a sound but a set of contrasts, it has an intensional interpretation. Any system of graphic symbols by means of which phonemes are represented is, then, likewise intensional. (1991:226)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">The abstractness of phonemes is apparent both in the trouble people have learning them and in sound spectrographs that show consonant phonemes subsumed by the vocalism that carries these sounds. Their identities are further obscured by changes they undergo in different phonetic environments. The physical substance associated with a given phoneme is often so flimsy that identification comes down to which competing analysis linguists ultimately (and sometimes arbitrarily) decide on. In other words, phonemes are conventional. But this fact has no bearing on the psychological impact of the exercise on children learning these conventions, which for most people in an alphabetic tradition represents their first and most significant foray into the world of analysis.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">How this process of identifying phonemes leads to the acquisition of analytical skills, which in turn facilitate the early stage of scientific creativity, has been described by several scholars. As Logan put it, “It is our claim that the constant repetition of phoneme analysis, every time it is written in an alphabetic form, subliminally promotes the skills of analysis and matching that are critical for the development of scientific and logical thinking” (1986:109). Fragmentation of concrete cognitive structures, the first step in the journey toward a new synthesis, is modeled largely on skills acquired and reinforced through use of an alphabet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">De Kerckhove argues in the same vein that the literate bias in the West “has been to break down information into parts and to order such parts in a proper sequence” (1986:290). Doing so clears the ground for the emergence of novel structures. As de Kerckhove explains,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">Regarding discovery, there is an inversely proportional ratio between the extent to which data is contextualized and the ability to recombine it, that is, to discover and create. . . . Western cultures . . . accustomed as they are by their coding system to break down information into its smallest components, and to recombine and reorder raw data into properly aligned and classified arrays, have a permanent access to the possibility of recombining individual units. (1988:108)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">More recently, Leonard Shlain, author of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Alphabet Versus the Goddess, </span><span class="font5">has argued that alphabetic literacy played the major role in effecting a general shift from right- to left-brained thinking, with profound implications for human society. Shlain notes that in contrast to images, whose parts are perceived simultaneously by the brain as wholes, alphabets force people to scan in a “linear sequence” and use analysis to break “each word down into its component letters” (1999:5). He further states:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">An alphabet by definition consists of fewer than thirty meaningless symbols that do not represent the images of anything in particular; a feature that makes them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">abstract. . . </span><span class="font4">. To perceive things such as trees and buildings through images delivered to the eye, the brain uses wholeness, simultaneity, and synthesis. To ferret out the meaning of alphabetic writing, the brain relies instead on sequence, analysis, and abstraction. (5)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Alphabetic writing provides a model for the analysis that creativity requires. We shall return to this theme in Chapters 8 and 9, where I explain the implications for creativity of nonalphabetic writing, which puts no such analytic demand on its users. Meanwhile, we must examine the relationship between the alphabet and other stages of creativity. Although the connections between alphabetic writing and creativity’s incubation, insight, and verification stages have received less attention from scholars, they are no less significant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">As I noted earlier, there is an emerging view among creativity specialists that the brain’s left and right hemispheres act semi-independently in the creative process. Each hemisphere carries out tasks to which it is structurally suited. The discrete cognitive style of the left hemisphere allows it to perform the analytic functions needed to reduce a problem to its abstract elements. These reduced patterns serve as input to the right hemisphere, where parallel searches are conducted for analogous representations that act as a model for the data’s reconfiguration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">synthetic</span><span class="font5"> operation exactly mirrors what occurs in the LH-dominated analytic stage. And just as the decomposition of syllables into phonemes offers a model for analysis, so does the recombination of phonemes into syllables, syllables into morphemes, morphemes into words and so on facilitate the exercise of synthetic operations, including those needed for creativity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Although synthesis is a part of all languages, including those with non-alphabetic writing (or no writing), alphabetic writing nurtures this skill by defining the targets. Preliterate cultures are notoriously inept at identifying words, sentences, and higher discourse units. Users of syllabic or Chinese character-based scripts likewise have a weaker grasp of linguistic units beyond the syllable level, as evidenced in their writing practices, simply because the orthography levies no such requirement. Alphabets, by contrast, usually have rules for word division and punctuation that depict higher linguistic structures. In East Asia neither word division nor punctuation is part of the indigenous tradition. There is no explicit model for synthesis in Asian orthography, just as there is none for analysis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Analysis and synthesis are complementary functions, both in the orthographic sphere and in the cognitive realm for which orthography serves as a model. Synthetic operations benefit by the granularity of the data. By parsing wholes into abstract parts, the likelihood of novel constructs emerging is multiplied. But synthesis is more than a random combination of elements. It is governed by rules that specify what potentially can go with what for the structure to retain its usefulness in the context of which it is part. Although the LH in creativity’s validation stage rejects many if not most such “legal” insights, the structures presented for validation would not get that far if they did not manifest an inherent plausibility imparted by systemic constraints.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">An exact analogue—model in our terms—for rule-governed synthesis is found in the way alphabet users combine phonemes to produce phonologically valid sequences that may not correspond to actual syllables and words (e.g., *slape). Similarly, there are morphological constraints on words, and syntactic constraints on sentences, that alphabet users are forced to live with because the orthography makes them transparent. When words and sentences are clearly identified, the basic rules associated with each linguistic level are guaranteed a space within which to operate. The addition of these constraints would seem at first blush to contradict the primary requirement for randomness, which is certainly true of creativity’s first stage. But we are dealing here with a combined process, whose requirements vary by stage. If analysis requires the destruction of conventional order, synthesis demands that the decomposed elements be reordered according to rules (i.e., more abstract patterns), which is precisely what happens both in the generation of language and in the production of novel concepts.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">There are other ways alphabetic literacy promotes right hemisphere synthesis. I referred earlier to the phenomenon, well known to creativity scientists, of language inhibiting creativity—despite everything I have written about the alphabet’s utility as a creativity model. Concepts must be named to be manipulated. But by naming them, the structures take on legitimacy and immunity from dissociation. Solutions to problems are sought outside these protected boundaries, even when the key to a solution may lie in disbanding a flawed (or outdated) concept. According to de Kerckhove (1988:106),</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">the authors [Findlay and Lumsden] seem to assume that linking is predicated on conceptual cognitive operations, independently of linguistic operations, when in reality, even at the level of the selective stabilization of synaptic connections, every semantic “node” may itself be dependent on the boundaries created by linguistic categories </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font4"> structured by the kind of access we have to such categories.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">I will take up this critical problem in detail in Chapter 9. It will suffice here simply to note that the affinity between lexical markers and the concepts they identify varies in strength according to the type of marker used. Spoken words bind to a concept most strongly for the same reason preliterate people find it difficult to separate their thoughts from concrete matters, namely, a lack of contrast between speech and an alternative representation that would lead to the isolation of their common antecedent. Similarly, when a morpheme is identified by a single marker (“address”), there is nothing to distinguish the address from the concept.<sup>13</sup> Syllabic writing changes things only minimally, since the relationship between the spoken and written address is holistic. By using an address that is fractional and abstract, alphabetic writing distances the address from the concept, weakening the external bond that holds it together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Alphabetic writing also contributes to the brain’s creative assets by identifying vowel phonemes, and hence restoring a balance between the two hemispheres. Recall that vowel symbols were the last to be added to the alphabet’s inventory of phonemes, postdating by centuries the emergence of consonantal alphabets. Traditional Chinese phonological study was also able to identify consonants in syllable-initial position as evidenced by the “spellings” used in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the fanqie</span><span class="font5"> (“reverse cut”) system to describe characters’ sounds by analogy, and by the separate status consonants had in rhyming dictionaries. Vowels, however, were lumped together gratuitously in a character’s “final” sound, which included medials, nuclear vowels, phonemic tone, descending diphthongs and triphthongs, and final consonants (treated as a class of tones). Neither the Western nor East Asian tradition considered vowels to be of comparable importance to consonants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">This neglect of vowels by traditional orthography and lexicography seems to have been caused, at least in part, by the left-lateralization of language’s basic functions. Although consonants, and syllables with consonants, lend themselves to processing in the brain’s left hemisphere, autonomous vowels, which resonate at lower frequencies than consonants and do not have meaning in themselves (Jurdant 1988:395), are more naturally processed on the right. Infants for a time do perceive vowels in their right hemispheres, until suppressed by the left-hemispheric dominance of speech. With no orthographic cues to separate vowels from the syllables in which they occur, vowels get processed on the left as part of the syllable, with a consequent attenuation of right hemisphere function and sensitivity. This hypothesis has been confirmed by laboratory tests on preliterate Westerners and on Japanese subjects, who show a clear left hemisphere advantage for almost all sounds including vowels, which neither </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">kana</span><span class="font5"> nor </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font5"> orthographies separately distinguishes. Literate Westerners, however, show an opposite tendency to perceive vowels in the right hemisphere, which Jurdant attributes to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">reactivation</span><span class="font5"> of “a specific cortical sensitivity of the right hemisphere” induced by the “graphic autonomy accorded to the vowel by the alphabetic system” (1988:388-89).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">How this phenomenon relates to creativity is evident in the following passage:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 17pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">The “vision” of vowels, to which the right hemisphere has access because of the alphabet, would translate into an incomprehensible and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">diffuse</span><span class="font5"> request, carrying an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">infinite</span><span class="font5"> number of possible sensory and behavioral interpretations. The alphabetic system is thus at the origin of a very peculiar cortical effect: the vowel has become the foundation of an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">indetermination</span><span class="font5"> on both the cognitive and cultural levels, which affects the left hemisphere all the more since it is the graphic breakup of the syllable unit that produces the effect. . . . The left hemisphere is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">forcibly required</span><span class="font5"> to comment on the sensorimotor effect triggered by the vocalic data perceived by the right hemisphere. (395, my emphasis)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">Thus not only does the breakup of the syllable, induced by alphabetic orthography, support the analytic (left hemisphere) function needed for creativity’s first stage. The syllabic fragmentation produces the same tutorial effect on the brain’s right hemisphere by restoring to it the nondiscrete functionality used in creativity’s second stage, which was coopted by the left brain’s “ownership” of language.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">But this is only part of the story. Note Jurdant’s statement about the left hemisphere being “required to comment” on right hemispheric data. Jur-dant expands this observation a few lines later by pointing out that the restoration of equilibrium between the two hemispheres facilitated selfconsciousness, “as produced by a quasi-permanent commentary by the left hemisphere on our sensorimotor reactions to vocalic graphic data.” My interest in this passage relates to its applicability to the latter stages of creativity, which depend on sharing data between the brain’s two halves. Editing the right hemisphere’s tentative proposals exactly describes the validation stage of creativity.' * To the extent that alphabetic literacy models this process, we have what appears to be another case of cognitive facilitation. Not only does use of an alphabet facilitate the analytic and synthetic stages of creativity, it also enhances hemispheric exchange, which I noted earlier is more important to creativity than abnormally good left or right hemisphere skills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Coordination of creative cognitive processes is facilitated by the alphabet on yet another plane. Alphabet users spend their lives shifting back and forth between concrete and abstract units. Spellings are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">abstracted</span><span class="font5"> from sounds, and pronunciations are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">synthesized</span><span class="font5"> from spellings, in an ongoing exercise of these two critical skills. For users of syllabic scripts, however, it all happens on the same level. There is no comparable exercise of analytic and synthetic skills. Alphabetic literacy also entails moving continuously between letters and words, which is analogous to what Koestler called movement within the “vertical abstractive hierarchy,” that is, abstracting a pattern on one level and applying it to another. The process mirrors the essence of the bisociative act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">Finally, alphabetic writing facilitates the communication of novel ideas, corresponding to what some researchers call a fifth stage of creativity. According to Havelock (1982:72), if a script is inherently ambiguous, material written in that script, to be understood, must have a limited range of content and rely on formulaic patterns. “Expected and recognizable discourse becomes highly traditional both in form and content” (75). Syllabaries in particular “encourage a selectivity practiced at the expense of the oral originals, a selectivity which concentrated upon central facts and sentiments, at the expense of the more unique, eccentric, and we might say, the more personal element in the oral repertoire” (96). Ong noted in the same vein that “Traditional expressions in oral cultures must not be dismantled: it has been hard work getting them together over the generations, and there is nowhere outside the mind to store them” (1982:39).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">Alphabets have no such limitations. Like all writing systems, an alphabet frees “the mind of conservative tasks, that is, of its memory work, and thus enables the mind to turn itself to new speculation” (41). Unlike syllabaries and character-based scripts especially, the discrete and meaningless elements on which an alphabet is based convey no inherent bias toward past conventions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5">In the previous section I gave examples of how alphabetic literacy promotes scientific creativity in each of its stages. These examples ultimately are hypotheses. We assume that the analytic, synthetic, and coordination skills required of alphabet users actually end in changes to the brain’s cognitive structure, and that these changes apply universally, not just to the specific “module” through which they are introduced. For these assumptions to be credible, we must show (1) that cultural artifacts, such as an alphabet, induce changes to the brain, and (2) that such changes can apply to a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">I will defer to later the question whether generations of exposure to an alphabet creates a heritable tendency toward creativity. Such a product of gene-culture coevolution would probably take the form of a genetic disposition to respond adaptively to cues in the environment—the use of an alphabet, a creative ethic—rather than a mature, fully elaborated structure, such as the language acquisition device claimed by some linguists for language. Although the cumulative effect of this “weak” tendency could be decisive, I am claiming more than a general disposition. My argument is that learning an alphabet, particularly in one’s early years, has an immediate re-ordering effect on the brain, which uses these structures for functionally similar tasks, including those involved in creativity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">The claim, in other words, is that culture shapes the brain, not in some metaphorical sense—but literally. There is widespread agreement among neuroscientists that a significant part of the brain’s design depends on stimuli produced by interaction with the features of an environment. This conclusion does not erase the nature-nurture controversy over the causes of behavior, since there is much room for disagreement over what part of behavior is genetically defined and what part is owed to learning.<sup>15</sup> Moreover, attributing the brain’s final design to culture seems in one sense to be no less deterministic than a comprehensive genetic theory. Instead of concentrating all developmental instructions within the genome, evolution has found it expedient to attenuate risk and promote ecological fitness by externalizing many of these instructions and allowing them to vary from one culture to another. Individual development is still constrained, though the illusion of choice helps make things bearable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">The physical process by which these external cues are reflected in the brain’s architecture is by now fairly well understood. According to Pasco Rakic, many of the brain’s neurons and their projections and synapses are initially overproduced, resulting in an early structure of diffuse but ill-defined connectivity. Later, as we interact with the environment, neurons or their processes compete for some resource such as electrical stimulation or surface contact with an adjacent cell as provided “by a variety of environmental factors, including functional activity” (1989:443). Connections that compete successfully for stimulation are stabilized and survive as a model of the environmental activity that provided the stimulation. Although the brain’s basic structure is genetically determined, its fine detail is left to competitive interaction. As Rakic describes it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">In the central nervous system initial developmental events such as cell proliferation, neuronal migration, and the outgrowth of axons may orderly proceed in the absence of activity-dependent cues. In contrast, the latter phases of development that includes the elimination of neurons, axons, and synapses and the shaping of the final circuits or topographical maps may be regulated by the state of electrical activity within the system . . . the precise pattern of synaptic activity cannot be predicted even with full knowledge of the instruction contained in the cell genome. The responsiveness of the developing brain to environmental influences, including experience, may be the anatomical basis of diversity in human behavior, talent, and creativity. (1989:453-54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">The brain’s final design is environmentally determined. What we do, and what we are exposed to, affect its actual structure. Donald agrees that environmental factors, including culture, impact significantly on the shape of the brain. In his words, “Cultures restructure the mind, not only in terms of its specific contents, which are obviously culture-bound, but also in terms of its fundamental neurological organization. . . . Culture can literally reconfigure the use patterns of the brain” (1991:14). He includes among the cultural influences “styles of reading and writing” (11). Deacon is unequivocal in his view of the importance of culture, and linguistic culture in particular, on the brain’s design. Addressing the issue of epigenetic influences, he notes that “the brain’s wiring is determined by virtue of the interaction of information conveyed by its connections, so the way that information is analyzed ultimately becomes reflected in the way the brain regions are ‘designed’ by this activity” (1997:221).&quot;’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">The link between written language and the brain’s physical development was brought out in the General Introduction to de Kerckhove and Lumsden’s collection of essays on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Alphabet and the Brain,</span><span class="font5"> where the two argue that “a specific writing system requires a specific set of neurological responses and decipherment strategies. The precision evidenced by a given writing system is thus a reflection of selective precision required from the brain” (1988:6). Luria, the psychologist, also pointed out the importance of culture, and written language in particular, on early cognitive development. As he described it,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">The tools that human beings in society use to manipulate that environment, as well as the products of previous generations which help shape the mind of the growing child, also affect these mental forms. In his development, the child’s first social relations and his first exposure to a linguistic system (of special significance) determine the forms of his mental activity. (1976:9)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;"><span class="font5">These arguments support the hypothesis that interacting with a particular writing system, as a salient feature of the environment, leads to changes in the brain’s structure, which once established set the stage for analogous behavior in other areas. Writing typically is acquired well before the brain’s cortical topography has been stabilized. Gazzaniga noted, “the developing child is gradually establishing a set of brain circuits that, once in place, can be selected by an environmental event—an assumption that studies of the developing human brain have shown to be true. Up into the teens, new cortical networks are being generated” (1992:60). Galaburda’s description of cortical structure at the time language is acquired reflects the brain’s receptivity to cultural artifacts in this stage of its development:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font4">By the time the human infant is fully exposed to its linguistic environment, local and far reaching neural connections are mostly established, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">though synaptic and con-nectional architectures are not.</span><span class="font4"> It would appear, therefore, that established synaptic architectures are not required for the initial stages of learning a language. Rather, they may emerge as a result of initial learning. (1989:461, my emphasis)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">The thesis that the cognitive skills associated with an alphabet reinforce skills needed for scientific creativity assumes that structures imported for a specific task are available for other tasks with similar requirements. Psychology and neuroscience support this generalist view. Vygotsky argued decades ago that “instruction in certain subjects develops the mental faculties in general, besides imparting the knowledge of the subject and specific skills,” referring to this as the “transfer of training” (1962:96). More recently, Calvin noted “Many organs are actually multipurpose and change their relative mix of functions over time. . . . it’s far easier for the brain to be multipurpose than it is for any other organ system” (1996:93-94).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Calvin’s views are representative of the “distributive” school of neuroscience, which regards all or most cognitive activity as a product of calculations done throughout large parts of the cortex. There can be no conflict between this school of thought and the thesis that analogous behaviors share a common neurological substrate. Calvin goes on to argue, however, that even a modular view of the brain’s structure need not be interpreted too narrowly, since “any ‘expert’ modules are also generalists.”<sup>17</sup> This rule also applies to those cortical areas that support linguistic functions. As Calvin put it, “One of the hazards of naming things in the brain is that we expect something called the language cortex to be devoted to language. But. . . cortical specialization is far more generalized” (101).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font5">Taylor shares Calvin’s belief that the brain’s language areas support more generalized behavior. In his view, “Any mechanisms used for language are available also for nonlinguistic perception or behavior, though they may have been refined and extended for use with language” (1988:324). Deacon rejects “language modules” entirely, arguing that language uses neural substrates that support multiple functions. Galaburda, commenting on a paper on hemispheric expressions of dyslexia,<sup>18</sup> noted, “Findings of non-linguistic as well as linguistic deficiencies in dyslexics would show either that language-related genes are shared among several cognitive capacities or that the factors interfering with their expression also interfere with genes related to other cognitive capacities.” (1989:170). Either way, the research demonstrates a link between writing and other cognitive tasks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">To sum up, neuroscience and psychology support the thesis that cognitive structure acquired through one type of behavior can facilitate other, similar behaviors. We have seen that the functional requirements for creativity and for using an alphabet are isomorphic, if not identical. Linking the two skills is justified not only by data that show alphabetic cultures at the forefront of scientific innovation. It is also consistent with the findings of cognitive science.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font5">By demonstrating a link between the alphabet and creativity, I have fulfilled half my agenda. It is now necessary to show why other types of orthography </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fail</span><span class="font5"> to produce the same cognitive effect. To do this, we must take a closer look at the structure of East Asian writing.</span></p>
