<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">Understanding the issues raised in this book presents two types of linguistic challenges. On the one hand, many of us steeped in the conventions of alphabetic writing tend to overlook the impact the alphabet has had on Western culture. Literate Westerners especially, who regard alphabetic writing as though it were a part of nature, are unlikely to ponder its cognitive and social dimensions and may fail to appreciate the full import of this technology. To understand the alphabet’s significance we must rethink assumptions held about writing since childhood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">On the other hand, applying to the East Asian situation what linguists in the alphabetic tradition have learned about writing’s role in creativity requires some knowledge of Chinese character-based systems. In this case, the challenge arises not just from naive assumptions about the nature of orthography but also from inadequate or misleading information about Asian languages and writing. Much of what we know, or think we know, about East Asian writing has been shaped by nonspecialists, who are often confused about the nature of these scripts, or by writers with a political agenda eager to manipulate the public’s perception of this “unique” form of writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">This is not to deny the existence of sober-minded scholarship on East Asian orthography.<sup>1</sup> It is just that Gresham’s Law applies here as in other areas: bad information (or disinformation) has tended to drive out good in forming the lay view of Chinese character-based writing. Accordingly, the present chapter’s goal is to provide the reader with enough accurate information about East Asian orthography to grasp the arguments made later in this book about its impact on creativity. The effect, I hope, will not be unlike the relationship between science and fiction, where truth has stranger and more profound implications than myth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">This chapter also provides a context for the case I am making on cognitive grounds against Chinese characters and the syllabic scripts derived from them. It is important to understand that the negative effects of character-based writing are not balanced by any linguistic benefits that accrue to their users. In fact, the argument that Asian orthography inhibits creativity is just one of many reasons why those who use these systems may wish to consider taking the final step toward modernization and replace them with an alphabet of letters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">We begin this chapter by considering Chinese, the first East Asian language to be written and the one with which the greatest variety of myths are associated. One such myth is that Chinese writing is well suited to the language using it. This statement is true only in a trivial sense: there is a mutual dependency between the language and writing, but it is selfgenerated. Let me be more specific.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">As evidence of the appropriateness of this writing to the language, linguists point to the close fit between the monosyllabic structure of most Sinitic morphemes (basic units of linguistic meaning) and the fact that characters each “have” meaning; to Chinese characters’ ability to discriminate the language’s many homonyms; and to the seven or more mutually unintelligible “dialects” in China that supposedly are unified by the character script. The theoretical basis for this belief is the American structuralists’ dictum that writing plays a secondary and comparatively unimportant role in language. The notion that writing, being “mere symbols of symbols,” could shape the evolution of a language was incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Were it not for this tendency to downplay the significance of writing, students of East Asian languages might have asked </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font18"> Chinese morphology, in the standard language at least, is largely monosyllabic. Or why Mandarin and the Sinitic parts of Korean and Japanese tolerate so many homonyms. Or why China finds it hard to unify the “dialects” under one standard, despite the political incentive to do so. If these and other linguistic anomalies were traced to effects the writing system has on the language, then the close “fit” between the two would lose its positive import and be viewed instead in terms of one system (writing) influencing the other (speech). Admitting a dynamic interplay between East Asian writing and speech would also lay the groundwork for accepting alternative orthographies, whose present “unsuitability” would disappear with use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Chinese characters were not designed to represent Chinese (or any other language) but as icons of physical phenomena. That is, they were </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">pic-tographic</span><span class="font18"> in origin. The early symbol for “tree” looked like a tree, the symbol for “mountain” resembled a mountain, and so on. Given the limits to this approach and, presumably, the inefficiency of trying to create a semiotic system anew when a system of signs—language—already existed, Chinese began using written symbols to represent things based on their phonetic contiguity. If the sound of the word for an object represented pictorially by a character was similar to the sound of another object with no written symbol, the character was borrowed to represent it. In time, the character lost its connection with the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">object</span><span class="font18"> it resembled and was perceived as a symbol for that object’s word and sound.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">In this respect, Chinese writing paralleled the development of writing in the West. The transition from symbol-as-icon to symbol-as-sound was also promoted by the stylization that occurred as “writers” sought to eliminate unnecessary strokes, reducing the visual similarity between symbol and referent. Chinese continued to create new characters by combining two forms to represent a concept that in some sense incorporated both meanings, for example, by linking the symbols for “sun” and “moon” to represent “bright.” However, this ideographic technique was overshadowed by the phonetic borrowing described above, which took on a new twist. As the number of referents associated with a symbol increased, Chinese added semantic signs (the so-called radicals or </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">biishbu)</span><span class="font18"> to indicate which of several meanings was intended. Thus the form M pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">qi</span><span class="font18"> (in Mandarin) means “chess” with the wood radical written to its side, “period of time” with the moon radical MB appended, and “his, hers, its” with no radical. These semantic-phonetic compounds now make up 85-90 percent of the character inventory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">The earliest known character inscriptions, on shells and bones, date from around 1200 B.c., by which time the conventions for creating characters had been established. Although pictographic and ideographic princi-pies were used in the early stages of the system’s development, Chinese by this time had mostly abandoned those techniques in favor of the phonetic approach, which remains the primary means of forming new characters to this day. By doing so, the system acquired an indissoluble link with the spoken language, albeit one that is not evident to casual observers accustomed to alphabetic writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">The link Chinese characters have with Chinese language is two-fold. On the one hand, most of these block-shaped symbols represent morphemes in Chinese. Morphemes are a language’s smallest units of meaningful sound. They may or may not be words. For example, “hunter” in English is a word composed of two morphemes “hunt” and “-er.” The first morpheme is also a word but the second is not, since it cannot stand by itself. Similarly, the word </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">lieren</span><span class="font18"> (hunter) in Chinese consists of two morphemes; /zr with the basic meaning of “hunt” and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ren</span><span class="font18"> with the basic meaning of “person.” Whereas </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ren</span><span class="font18"> is also a word able to stand alone, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">lie</span><span class="font18"> is not, since it is always joined with other morphemes (a “bound” form). Morphemes have more diffuse meanings than words, as seen in both the English and Chinese examples.-'</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">Since each morpheme is associated with a sound, characters representing morphemes ipso facto acquire a sound. Hence not only are the characters linked to a specific language by virtue of representing that language’s morphemes, they are also in a direct sense representing the language’s sounds. The key difference between the way characters represent sounds in Chinese and the way letters represent sounds in English is that Chinese does it holistically. Each character as a whole, or in compound characters through its “phonetic” part (which is or was a whole character itself), portrays a morpheme’s sound by convention. There is no discrete modeling of sound in the design of the written symbol. None of the strokes or groups of strokes that make up a character or its phonetic element has a defined relationship to the sound (normally a syllable) or any part of the sound.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">Because Chinese characters represent both morphemes and syllables, linguists use the term “morphosyllabic” to identify the system within the taxonomy of world orthographies. Does this mean all Chinese morphemes are made up of one syllable? Not at all. Although this is </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">largely</span><span class="font18"> the case in modern standard Mandarin, particularly as it is written, it was not true of the archaic language, nor does it apply to the spoken language in its many varieties. Rather, the monosyllabism of Chinese morphology is an artifact of character-based writing, which imposes a one-to-one relationship on the language’s sound, script, and meaningful units. Given the holistic relationship between characters, their meanings, and their sounds, characters as the most conspicuous </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">units</span><span class="font18"> in that triad define all legs of the relationship, including the link between sound and meaning—a link that is reinterpreted in terms of the writing system’s requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Studies by Boodberg (1937), Kennedy (1964), and Mair (2001) show that earlier stages of Chinese had many multisyllable morphemes, a fact that was apparent even in the written record. Modern varieties of Chinese such as Shanghainese and Min (Taiwanese), which lack a written standard, retained this feature and may even have expanded it. This is typical of languages the world over. Chinese Mandarin—written Mandarin especially— with its monosyllabic morphology is an anomaly even within the Chinese family of languages. There are two ways the character writing system brought this about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">First, there is significant pressure on users to impute meaning to </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">each </span><span class="font18">character of a multi-syllable morpheme, even when the morpheme’s one meaning is expressed over all of the syllables. The fact that Chinese feel obliged to assign as many characters to a term as there are syllables in the term is a function of the shift that occurred in the typology of Chinese writing to a phonetic-based system. This change did not, however, nullify the practice of associating a meaning with each character. If two characters in a single term share the same meaning, one character tends to take on the meaning of the whole term. That character is then used alone or in new compound terms with different morphemes, in a de facto validation of the reduction process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">The other way characters impose a monosyllabic morphology on the language is through their high degree of graphic redundancy. Whether one regards syllables or morphemes as the primary targets of representation, we are dealing, in earlier stages of the language at least, with several </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">thousand</span><span class="font18"> items, each with a unique symbol. The large number of different symbols entails a commensurate degree of complexity in their forms, more than the complexity that is associated with their sounds. With so much visual information available, there is no need to use all characters of a polysyllabic morpheme if any one character is distinct enough to convey the meaning of the whole term.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Both practices reinforced the expectation that each graph would have a meaning of its own, besides its monosyllabic pronunciation. It was not so much a case of literate users going back and reanalyzing existing morphemes (although this did and does occur) as it was an ongoing, coevolutionary process. New accretions to the literary language, introduced through writing, were adjusted to conform to the emerging one character = one morpheme paradigm. The process continues today, when single-morpheme polysyllabic foreign expressions, represented at first in Chinese with as many characters as there are syllables in the word, are stripped of all but one syllable-character. New indigenous terms, and even caiques based on foreign models, meanwhile are built up deliberately from monosyllabic morphemes, which given their sparse phonetic properties cannot maintain their identity as morphemes without the characters’ support. The result is a standard language made up of thousands of singlesyllable morphemes.<sup>3</sup> Were it not for the written characters, this situation would not exist.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Another effect characters have had on Chinese and the Sinitic parts of other Asian languages is a high incidence of homophony. Since Chinese characters convey a great deal of visual information compared to the phonetic information associated with them, there is no incentive for writers to take a word’s sound into account when introducing new vocabulary. Thus a term that is clear when written may make no sense at all when spoken. While this gap between visual and auditory redundancy is less noticeable for everyday terms, the literate lexicon, which accounts for most words in Chinese and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font18"> vocabulary shared between East Asian languages, was built with the expectation that terms would be identified visually, not aurally. Accordingly, words are formed from combinations of monosyllabic morphemes that have few distinguishing phonetic characteristics.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">The problem is not just with exact homonyms, which number in the thousands, but with near homonyms or paronyms—words that differ only minimally, by one phonetic feature. Although context and other paralin-guistic devices help speakers sort out the differences, readers of texts have fewer extrinsic cues. They depend almost entirely on the graphical information before them. As long as the text is in Chinese characters, phonetic ambiguity is not an issue. But the conflict between the amount of information needed to make a discourse intelligible in speech and the type of information Chinese characters provide tends to create a wider gap between the spoken and written norms than one finds in alphabetic cultures, with cognitive implications that I will discuss in later chapters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Chinese characters, far from resolving the Sinitic homonym problem, in fact created it. Another area where the characters are perversely credited for solving problems they cause is China’s so-called “dialect” issue. Although few Chinese would agree with me, the term “Chinese” does not refer to a language but to a </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">group</span><span class="font18"> or </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">branch</span><span class="font18"> of related languages that have less in common than the Romance languages have with each other. Besides Mandarin spoken in the north, Chinese includes six or seven other major languages used in the remainder of the country and abroad, among which Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Min (which includes Taiwanese) are the most prominent. These “southern” varieties are primary languages for tens of millions of Chinese speakers. For Shanghainese it is closer to 100 million.<sup>4</sup> Each has significant differences in phonology, vocabulary, and syntax and all are mutually unintelligible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">In any other context these nonstandard varieties would be regarded as different languages. But in China they are treated as “dialects” </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">{fangydn)^ </span><span class="font18">for political expediency and because, with the marginal exception of Cantonese, they lack writing.’’ Orthography, besides its tangible effect on the development of a language and on the psychology of its speakers, confers legitimacy on a language and political status on its users. Since the nonMandarin varieties of Chinese are mostly unwritten, they are portrayed as less than full-fledged languages, even though they qualify as languages by any linguistic measure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">The other factor supporting the lay notion that these languages are dialects is the belief that the writing system transcends their differences. Literate Chinese supposedly are able to read texts based on different varieties of speech when they are written in characters. In a sense this is true. Since characters depict sounds holistically, it matters little whether one reads a character or a series of characters in Mandarin or with the sounds of some other Chinese “dialect.” But does this unify China linguistically or does it perpetuate the divisions? Let’s look closer at this transdialectal phenomenon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Since Cantonese, Shanghainese, and other nonstandard varieties differ from Mandarin not just in sound but also in vocabulary and grammar, the characters cannot bridge this gap by themselves, even with their relative neutrality toward sound.' Much of the core vocabulary of non-Mandarin Chinese has no counterpart in Mandarin and no recognized character representation. Conversely, many Mandarin terms for which characters do exist are foreign to non-Mandarin speakers. The fact that nonstandard speakers can read a text in the standard language simply means that these speakers are bilingual. They have learned written Mandarin </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">as a second language.</span><span class="font18"> They know enough vocabulary and grammar to make sense of Mandarin texts, much as I know enough French words and grammar to read that language (without being able to pronounce it convincingly, much less to speak it fluently). If Chinese characters have unified the Chinese languages, then the alphabet has unified French and English.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">The characters do allow nonstandard speakers to use their own pronunciations to read Mandarin texts. So instead of acclimating to the national standard, nonstandard speakers reinforce their own speech habits and add to the vitality of their “dialect” by introducing new vocabulary from Mandarin, which they pronounce their own way by analogy. Whether alphabetic scripts </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font18"> be used to provide China’s non-Mandarin speakers with the means to become literate in their own language is a political question outside the scope of the present inquiry. But one thing is certain: since non-Mandarin speakers are forced anyway to learn a second language, it would make more sense from the viewpoint of those promoting unity if this bilingualism were achieved through Mandarin written in the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">pinyin </span><span class="font18">alphabet.<sup>8</sup> The incentive to learn the national standard, including its pronunciation, would be higher than it is today if one’s ability to read depended on it. As it is now, nonstandard speakers work their way through standard texts using whatever pronunciation comes naturally, not fully learning Mandarin and not reading their own languages either.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">So much for the unity provided by Chinese characters. One can argue that the characters unite China culturally. But the linguistic argument for unity is nonsense. There are—to put it bluntly—no absolute advantages to using a character script, not anywhere in the world, and not in China. The only utility characters offer is relief from the distortions their own use created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">On the other hand, their complexity saddled Chinese speakers with a significant handicap. This handicap extends beyond the impediments that are usually cited to encompass serious obstacles to creative thinking. While this thesis, given its import, will remain controversial for some, virtually no one disputes that the number of Chinese characters and their complexity represent heavy burdens on their users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Estimates of the number of characters vary widely depending on the criteria. The largest dictionaries have upward of 50,000 entries, many of which are variants or have dropped out of use. Calculations based on modern sources yield a figure of about 6,900 characters, 4,500 of which are enough to read most types of materials (Hannas 1997:130-33). Each character, which has on average ten to twelve strokes, is unique and must be learned by itself. Although they can for purposes of pedagogy be broken into recurring components, the components themselves number over 1,000 (850 phonetics and another 200 or so radicals). It is not enough to remember what components a character has, since they are positioned differently with respect to each other depending on the character. And not all characters can be broken down into radical plus phonetic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;"><span class="font18">The time needed to learn and write Chinese characters is justified by those who favor them by appeals to culture and aesthetics. Linguistically, however, the argument that the characters are </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">intrinsically</span><span class="font18"> better suited to the language than an alphabet is empty. This applies not only to their use in China but also to the claim that they “unite” East Asians by allowing them to read one another’s languages. If Chinese characters cannot bridge the gap between “dialects” in China, they are even less able to overcome the typological distinctions between Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Not only are the languages themselves different. Independent changes made to character shapes in China and Japan have eliminated much of the continuity the system used to have, rendering even the shared Sinitic vocabulary obscure. The transitivity ascribed to characters is just one more myth in the rich inventory of fables associated with Chinese writing.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Japan's Mixed Script</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font18">Chinese characters suit Chinese because they generated this “suitability” themselves. What of Japanese, the other major East Asian language where characters still play an obligatory role? As I pointed out earlier in this book, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> (the Japanese word for “Chinese characters”) helped Japan absorb thousands of Sinitic loanwords during the fifth through eighth centuries, when Japanese was first written. Since the two elements—writing and Sinitic vocabulary—were introduced simultaneously, the same dependency between phonetically vague morphemes and characters that exists in Chinese found its way into Japanese. Borrowed Chinese morphemes, which are as common in Japanese as Latin and French are in English, have fewer phonetic distinctions relative to speech than they have visual distinctions relative</span></p>

<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font18">Tibetan orthography (from “Homage to Avalokiteshvara,” </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Thirty-Seven Bodhisattva Practices').</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">to writing, creating a wider gap between the two media than what is normal for alphabetically written languages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">In fact, phonetic ambiguity is more of a problem in Japanese than in Chinese because of changes the Sinitic loans underwent. Ancient Chinese, the name given to the language used in northern China around </span><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font18"> 600 when Chinese writing and vocabulary were introduced to Japan, had some 3,800 syllables supported by several final consonants and tones.<sup>9</sup> Japanese, however, has fewer than 300 distinct syllables, which meant that the borrowed Sinitic sounds had to be reduced to match Japanese pronunciation. Tones, phonemic in Chinese, were leveled out entirely. Since Japanese also lacks syllable-final consonants (-« is a syllabic nasal sound), Chinese words with consonant endings were rendered in Japanese by merger </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(-m, -n, -ng &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font18">-ri) and by adding a second syllable to the morpheme </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(-ki, -ku, -ti, -tri)</span><span class="font18"> whose first consonant captured the original word’s consonant final. Even with this device, Japanese ended up with only 319 different sounds for its entire corpus of Sinitic morphemes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">The result is a language whose literary lexicon has few phonetic contrasts. It is noted that a Chinese syllable can be associated in Chinese with two dozen or more characters depending on its meaning. This ambiguity is managed by linking monosyllabic morphemes into polysyllabic compound words. For example, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ke</span><span class="font18"> (“category”) and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">xue</span><span class="font18"> (“study”) become </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kexue</span><span class="font18"> (“science”). In Japanese the number of characters associated with a Sinojapanese sound (the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">onyomi</span><span class="font18"> or “Sinitic reading” of a character) exceeds the number in Chinese by an order of magnitude. Considering just the 4,775 characters in Andrew Nelson’s popular </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Japanese-English Character Dictionary,</span><span class="font18"> we find 105 characters pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">so,</span><span class="font18"> 160 characters read </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">sho,</span><span class="font18"> and so on. The numbers grow in large dictionaries that have 10,000 or more characters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Japanese speakers combine these morphemes into multisyllable words. But the number of homonyms and paronyms is still overwhelming. The Russian linguist Korchagina found two dozen words in a modern Japanese-Russian dictionary pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">koko,</span><span class="font18"> another twenty-three pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kosho,</span><span class="font18"> and so on (1977:43). Some of these words cannot be properly identified even in context. Using the Chinese </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kexue</span><span class="font18"> example given, the equivalent Japanese sound </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kagaku</span><span class="font18"> means either “science” or “chemistry.” Although </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> erase this ambiguity in writing, their availability deprives speakers of the incentive to generate phonetically viable words that can be understood independently in speech. Some Japanese linguists have tried to excuse this state of affairs by calling Japanese a “visual” language, as if readers of other languages are somehow less able to get information off a written page. Other linguists, such as Mantaro Hashimoto (1987), have conceded that the Sinitic word-building mechanism in Japanese is no longer viable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">If </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> provided any linguistic benefit to compensate users for the distortions they cause in speech, then perhaps their use could be justified. But their effect on Japanese writing has been just as devastating as it was on Chinese, yielding by all accounts an orthography so complex that it makes Chinese seem simple by comparison. The problem begins with the fact that Japanese and Chinese are typologically different. Chinese is an isolating language whose syntactic relations are determined by word order and grammatical particles. Hence, writing that language in characters is less convoluted than it could be because there is no need to represent inflection. Words are written with as many characters as there are syllablemorphemes. There are no morphological changes for the writing system to capture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Japanese is an agglutinative language whose words are inflected to show grammatical relations. Unlike Chinese, Japanese verbs and adjectives are divided into stationary roots and endings that change to reflect a word’s syntactic role. These changes must be shown in the orthography. To do this, Japanese write inflected words in two parts. The fixed or content part is depicted by one or more </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji.</span><span class="font18"> The inflected part is rendered phonetically in a syllabary called </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana,</span><span class="font18"> in this case </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hiragana.</span><span class="font18"> This co-use of multiple scripts adds a layer of complexity to a system already made complex by the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji.</span><span class="font18"> Moreover, the boundary between where </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> stop in a word and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana</span><span class="font18"> begin is variable and confusing. Since the same Japanese </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> is read differently depending on the word it represents (see below) the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana</span><span class="font18"> at the end of a word is sometimes arbitrarily pushed forward into the word’s semantic part to give readers a clue to which word is meant. The benefit is at the expense of the writer, who must memorize separate rules for how each inflected word is parsed by the orthography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Inflection was one of two drivers behind the evolution of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana.</span><span class="font18"> The other was the need to write Japanese names, which have no equivalent in Chinese and no </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> with which to write them. The problem was solved by using </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> phonetically as a syllabary. Since each character had a monosyllabic or nearly monosyllabic </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font18"> pronunciation<sup>10</sup> modified for Japanese speech, Japanese used some </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> for their sound alone, irrespective of their meanings, to “spell” the sounds of a Japanese word. Eventually this subset of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> was reduced to the forty-eight symbols needed to represent the language’s basic syllables (mora). The symbols were also stylized to the point where they lost any resemblance to their original shapes. Two </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana </span><span class="font18">sets were thus created: </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hiragana,</span><span class="font18"> which are cursive in form, and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">katakana, </span><span class="font18">which are angular. Since they are mixed with </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> in the same text, the system is known as a “mixed script” </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(kanji-kana majiribun).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">Besides being used for Sinitic vocabulary, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> are also used to write indigenous Japanese words that have roughly the same meaning as the character has in Chinese. For example, the character (“family, household”) pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">jia</span><span class="font18"> in Mandarin and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ka</span><span class="font18"> in Sino-Japanese represents a Japanese word with a similar meaning pronounced </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ie.</span><span class="font18"> Although they share the same character, the Japanese word is unrelated etymologically to the Chinese morpheme. These </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kunyomi</span><span class="font18"> or “native readings” of characters enable Japanese to perceive </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> as a part of their language, a perception not shared by Koreans for reasons I shall discuss. They also make a complicated system more difficult by requiring readers to determine whether a </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> represents a Sino-Japanese morpheme or a native Japanese word.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">As if more complexity were needed, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> tend to be linked not with one Japanese word but with several that have the same broad meaning. The character . which has the general meaning of “life,” can be read a dozen ways depending on its particular meaning. Now the same character in Chinese also has a range of nuances, but that range is subsumed by the same spoken sound. By contrast, there can be as many </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kunyomi,</span><span class="font18"> that is, native Japanese words, assigned to a character as the character has nuances in Chinese. These </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kun</span><span class="font18"> readings, which vary from none to several depending on the character, are in addition to the borrowed </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font18"> pronunciations, which also tend to stack up as a result of a word and its character being introduced from different parts of China at different times. Sometimes context provides the only clue to which reading is intended.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">In principle, each subscript has its own semantic domain. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Kanji</span><span class="font18"> are used primarily for content words, especially nouns and verbs. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hiragana</span><span class="font18"> portray elements of the language used for syntactic relations, such as inflection and grammatical particles. They also render indigenous words that have no </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> representation. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Katakana</span><span class="font18"> are used chiefly to write onomatopoeia and Western loanwords, which in some ty pes of materials are as common as the Sinitic vocabulary. They are sometimes used alongside individual </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> to show their pronunciation </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(furigana).</span><span class="font18"> This practice of using one set of symbols </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(katakana)</span><span class="font18"> to explain another set </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">(kanji)</span><span class="font18"> is officially discouraged but refuses to disappear, which suggests that Japanese at times are confused about how to interpret the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> that make up the backbone of their orthography.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Although these guidelines for use exist in principle, the division of labor between </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana</span><span class="font18"> is not nearly so clear-cut, in part due to attempts to improve the system. The Japanese government in 1946 began a series of reforms that limited the number of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji,</span><span class="font18"> simplified their shapes, and regularized the sounds with which they are associated. Like all attempts to streamline character-based systems, the chief effect of these reforms was to transfer the complexity from one arena to another. With fewer </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> and approved readings, users are forced to avoid words whose </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> fall outside the approved list or spell them out, syllable by syllable, in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Now with the possible exception of John DeFrancis, I would be the last person to complain about a character-based orthography yielding to phonetic writing. But these halfway reforms, meant to breathe life into an ailing system, erased what little regularity the system did have by disrupting the natural semantic-based assignment of orthographic elements. Content words previously expressed in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> now appear in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kana</span><span class="font18"> if their original representation failed to make the approved list and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font18"> a writer is disposed to follow the new convention. Readers must pause to consider whether a string of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hiragana</span><span class="font18"> represents a substantive element or part of the grammar. Moreover, compound words previously written with two or more </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> are now split into </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">ha\f-kanji,</span><span class="font18"> half</span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">-kana</span><span class="font18"> if one of the word’s characters is proscribed, which disrupts the flow of thought as readers shift from one mode of processing to another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">The price this complex system exacts from Japanese users goes beyond the difficulties involved in learning it, formidable as that task is. Japanese industry, for all its technological sophistication, is pinched by this orthographic bottleneck that makes office work less efficient than in countries where writing is done alphabetically. Software development, another area where Japan’s output is less than it could be, is also hampered by the need to deal with the vagaries of the mixed script. These problems are in addition to the cognitive drawbacks the script entails, on which we will focus in subsequent chapters.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">Compared to Japanese, Korean writing is a model of simplicity. Although this is a source of great pride to Koreans, on an international scale the orthographic picture is not as enviable as it appears locally. Koreans still struggle with the legacy of Chinese characters: in the South, where </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja </span><span class="font18">(Chinese characters) are part of the orthography; in the North, where the characters paradoxically are taught as an </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">aid</span><span class="font18"> to understanding </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">A\-hangul </span><span class="font18">texts; and in both countries, where the characters left their mark on the design of the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> alphabet. Five hundred years after the invention of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> and more than fifty years after it was rehabilitated after Korea’s release from foreign occupation, the orthographic situation is in a state of flux.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">Chinese characters were used in Korea as early as the first century B.c. to write the Chinese language. By the fifth century A.D. Koreans were borrowing them to record elements of their own language. Two techniques made this possible. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hanja</span><span class="font18"> could be used semantically to represent indigenous morphemes in a system called </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">idu.</span><span class="font18"> Like the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kun</span><span class="font18"> readings in Japanese, Korean words were associated with the characters “directly” on the basis of their meanings. Alternatively, a character could stand for a borrowed Chinese morpheme and its sound.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">Korean, like Japanese, is an agglutinative language with inflected endings that must be captured in writing for a text to make sense. Chinese characters were sometimes used for this task when their meanings coincided with Korean grammatical morphemes. But as the identification between Chinese writing and the Korean language grew, Koreans began to interpret </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> in terms of their </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">sounds,</span><span class="font18"> both the Sinitic sound associated with each </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> and the sound of any Korean word the character represented. A subset of characters was eventually used to spell out indigenous morphemes that were hard to depict semantically.<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font18">This phoneticization of characters in Korean might have led, as it did in Japan, to a full-fledged Lzw-Iike syllabary had it not been for one significant fact. Unlike Japanese with just a few hundred syllables to distinguish, Korean speakers use some 1,100 different syllables. For historical periods, the inventory was closer to 1,700. Depicting each syllable with a unique graph would have required a syllabary that rivaled in size the number of commonly used Chinese characters. Evolution of the character script in</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">Korea had reached a dead end. Although </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">idwwas</span><span class="font18"> used until the nineteenth century in formal state documents, writing Korean in a style that approached the vernacular meant reaching outside the inherited tradition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hangul</span><span class="font18"> (literally, “Korean writing”<sup>12</sup>) was Korea’s answer—a phonemic alphabet invented to fill the void where </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">idu</span><span class="font18"> and other character-based systems left off. Although the idea for an alphabet was known to Koreans through Sanskrit and the central Asian scripts, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> itself, including its shapes and mapping relationship to the language, owes little to foreign influence. It appears to have been the brainchild of the country’s monarch, who was personally involved in its design and popularization. Promulgated in 1446 under the name </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hunmin Chong’um</span><span class="font18"> (“correct sounds to instruct the people”), the system was promoted initially as an aid to help people learn the sounds of Chinese characters, although some Korean scholars believe it was meant from the start as a substitute for character writing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">At present, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> uses 40 letters to represent the language’s 19 consonants and 21 vowels (13 of which are diphthongs). Of these letters, 16 are actually compounds made from basic letters to represent tense consonants, glides, and labialized vowels, so the real number of symbols is on a par with Western alphabets. Some letters are shaped to depict the position of the tongue and other speech organs used to form that particular sound. While its origin is lost on most readers, the care and sophistication that went into the system’s design is noteworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">There is no reason why these </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> symbols could not be strung together serially, as letters are in the West, to spell out words. Korean linguists did experiment with this idea more than fifty years ago to facilitate the use of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> with typewriters and printing equipment. Nonetheless </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> has always been written in small, character-like blocks, with two or more </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> letters squeezed into the matrix depending on the number of phonemes in the syllable. The letters vary in shape, size, and position, according to their phonological roles. This arrangement complicates printing. It also focuses Koreans’ awareness on syllables instead of on the fractional parts that make up syllables. Whether this syllabic convention was adopted out of habit or to help disguise the radical nature of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul,</span><span class="font18"> its connection with Chinese writing is apparent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">This important issue aside, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul is</span><span class="font18"> in all other respects an excellent system potentially able to represent Korean without support from Chinese characters. However, historical and linguistic factors continue to give the</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">characters a role in the orthographic practices of both Koreas. Sixty percent or more of Korean vocabulary is formed from Sinitic morphemes introduced through Chinese characters with the expectation that they would be written and read in the same manner. Accordingly, when written in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul,</span><span class="font18"> Sino-Korean words lose some distinctiveness due to their relative lack of phonetic contrasts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Linguists who favor using </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> as a stand-alone system, without Chinese characters, argue that the same potential for ambiguity exists in speech but Koreans suffer no impediments in this regard. Why should there be a problem </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">writing</span><span class="font18"> phonetically? And in fact novels, newspapers for the most part, and other forms of popular literature get by without </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja. </span><span class="font18">Technical literature or serious genres where Sinitic morphemes dominate the discourse is another story. For people who know </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja,</span><span class="font18"> the texts are clearer when these morphemes are in characters. South Koreans therefore sometimes mix the two systems together. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hanja</span><span class="font18"> are used for borrowed Chinese vocabulary when the word is perceived as problematic. Often this means writing the word’s first use in characters and subsequent appearances in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul.</span><span class="font18"> All other words, including common Sinitic terms whose use is well established, are written in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">The chief difference between this and Japan’s mixed script is Koreans do not write indigenous words with Chinese characters. The earlier </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">idu </span><span class="font18">practice was abandoned. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hanja</span><span class="font18"> today represent Sino-Korean vocabulary and nothing else. Restricting Chinese characters to Sinitic words has made Koreans less enamored of Chinese characters than the Chinese or even the Japanese, who link </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">kanji</span><span class="font18"> to indigenous vocabulary. As a result, Koreans tend to use </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> only when needed to disambiguate vague Sinitic terms, whereas the Japanese use them wherever they can.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Another reason </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">a\}-hangul</span><span class="font18"> writing works involves something called “false </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul.'&quot;</span><span class="font18"> Texts written in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> are intelligible, some say, because a reader’s latent knowledge of Chinese characters makes the Sinitic terms more comprehensible. Even though a word is written phonetically in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul,</span><span class="font18"> one can sort out the possible meanings by guessing what the sounds </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">potentially </span><span class="font18">mean. The argument resembles what used to be claimed by American educators for Latin, which supposedly facilitates learning high-level English vocabulary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;"><span class="font18">Given that the Koreans who make this argument are character-literate scholars opposed to script reform for their own reasons, I was inclined at first to doubt its validity. Moreover, had not North Korea abandoned Chinese characters entirely for </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all-hangul</span><span class="font18"> writing? However, it turns out the North also had trouble with </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all-hangul</span><span class="font18"> writing and was forced to reinstate characters into the schools. Junior and senior high school students are now taught 2,000 Chinese characters, some 200 more than in the South and 55 more than in Japan.<sup>13</sup> DPRK college students are exposed to more than 3,000. Although North Korea for all intents stopped using </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja, </span><span class="font18">the success of its </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all-hangul</span><span class="font18"> script depends on learning the characters as background.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">At this point I would like to comment on writing reform, because it has played an important role in the development of East Asian orthography. Since the subject has been covered in a number of studies, I shall be brief.<sup>1</sup> •</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Writing reform in East Asia is not at all like proposals made in the West to revise English or some other language’s spelling rules, which mostly go unnoticed by the public. In East Asia orthographic revision has attracted considerable attention from language experts and other interested persons, leading at times to major changes in writing practices. Interest seems to wax and wane with the health of the economy and the country’s political fortunes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Of the three East Asian countries that use Chinese characters, Japan was the first to consider ways to simplify the orthography or replace it. Contact with European missionaries and traders in the eighteenth century persuaded some Japanese of the need to switch to all-phonetic writing. By the beginning of the Meiji period (1868-1911) serious proposals had been laid out to limit the number of Chinese characters, abandon them entirely for </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all-kana</span><span class="font18"> or alphabetic writing, and in one extreme case abandon Japanese altogether.<sup>13</sup> Membership in reform groups at times numbered over 10,000. Although suppressed by nationalism during the war, these movements paved the way for a dozen lesser revisions carried out between 1946 and 1981, which addressed the mixed script’s worst excesses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Paradoxically, nationalism in China was associated until recently with efforts to </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">reform or replace</span><span class="font18"> the character script, as part of a larger effort to modernize (DeFrancis 1950). Several different approaches to character simplification were considered in the 1920s and 1930s, which led to reforms that reduced the number of strokes in characters and the number of characters in use. An effort was also made to expand the role of phonology in characters, both to simplify the system and prepare the nation for fully phonetic writing. Economic growth after 1975, however, and disillusionment with radical reforms in general dampened the enthusiasm for positive change. Although the government disavows plans to replace characters with </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">pinyin</span><span class="font18">—China’s alphabetic notation—</span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">pinyin</span><span class="font18"> is quietly becoming a de facto second script in a number of applications, including the critical area of computing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">In Korea, writing reform has focused on the use of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">A\-hangul.</span><span class="font18"> Unlike China and Japan, where much attention has been paid to limiting character use, Korean reformers for the most part view the issue in terms of using some </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> or none at all. The availability of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> as a phonemic orthography affords them that option. By the same token, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangups</span><span class="font18"> own success and its national character have diverted Korean attention from the use of an alphabet of Western letters. Although several romanization schemes were devised (and changed as many times) to represent Korean internationally, there is no serious movement to replace </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font18">Korea first adopted </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">A\-hangul</span><span class="font18"> writing in 1895 as an egalitarian measure introduced by a reform government. Although the program was short-lived, the possibility of writing without Chinese characters continued to intrigue Koreans through the Japanese era (1910-45), erupting into a full-fledged movement at the end of the occupation to oust </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> entirely. By 1949 the North was using </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hangul</span><span class="font18"> without characters for all publications, including technical materials. South Korea in 1948 legislated </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">A\-hangul</span><span class="font18"> for official documents, but was forced to rescind the measure under pressure from conservative elements. The struggle between those who favor </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all-hangul</span><span class="font18"> and those willing to use it with a limited number of Chinese characters continues to be played out today in government, the schools, and among publishers.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Vietnam's Unfinished Reform</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font18">China, Japan, and Korea—the three nations of the “Chinese character cultural sphere” at which most of the arguments in this book are directed— were not the only countries to have used Chinese characters. Vietnam through most of its history also used them to write both Chinese and its indigenous language. Accordingly, many of the issues connected with character use described here and in later chapters could apply to Vietnam, given the influence that Chinese characters had on the language, its system of writing, and the psychology of its users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Nevertheless I am mostly leaving Vietnam out of this study for two reasons. First, I have not determined that technology transfer of the sort practiced by other East Asian countries is carried out by Vietnam except at the most rudimentary level. Vietnam’s science publications and journals on S&amp;T policy are devoted to agriculture, worldwide news, and sadly, exhortations about the need for science to rebuild the country. There is no mention of appropriating Western technology as discussed in the other East Asian countries’ publications. Centuries of foreign domination, decades of warfare, and years of socialist reconstruction have left Vietnam in no position to compete for or to absorb the high-tech innovations that are central to the economies of the major regional players.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Another reason for omitting Vietnam is that the country no longer uses characters as part of its orthography. Although still employed decoratively, they have not been used to record the language for nearly one hundred years. Vietnamese is written today with a combination of Roman letters and diacritics that enables it to get by on its own without Chinese characters despite a heavy overlay of Sinitic terms. Unlike Korea, where a knowledge of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">hanja</span><span class="font18"> supports </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">^\\-hangul</span><span class="font18"> writing, Chinese characters are not taught in Vietnamese schools. Vietnam’s independence from written Chinese is nearly complete.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">Like other countries on China’s periphery, Vietnam was using characters to write Chinese and elements of Vietnamese by the eighth century, when China’s Tang dynasty was at its peak. Adapting the characters to Vietnamese was facilitated by the structure of the language, which like Chinese is uninflected. There are no multi-syllable syntactic elements or morphological changes to complicate the representation. But with nearly 5,000 different syllables (including six tones in the north), a practical syllabary based on Chinese characters never emerged. Although characters were used for Vietnamese words of similar sound, the assignments were not generalized to </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font18"> words of the same sound.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font18">As in Japanese, a character in Vietnamese could have many pronunciations depending on which Sino-Vietnamese word it represented. The difference is that there are few or no cases of Chinese characters used </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">semantically</span><span class="font18"> for </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">native</span><span class="font18"> Vietnamese words. Multiple readings of characters were the result of importing them into different parts of the country where pronunciations varied. Also sound change and semantic drift in China caused the same character to be borrowed in Vietnam for different but etymologically related words. Given the long history of contact between the two languages, the number of Sino-Vietnamese words depicted by one character grew to the point where Vietnamese writers would often use diacritics to show whether a character represented an older or more recent borrowing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Adaptation of the character script did not stop at existing characters. Writers invented entirely new characters specifically for indigenous Vietnamese words (or in some cases for Sinitic morphemes so well established that they were no longer perceived as borrowings). Two principles were used to create the new symbols. A pair of characters, whose combined sense equated to the meaning of the Vietnamese morpheme, could be written together as a unit. More commonly, Vietnamese followed the Chinese practice of making new characters out of semantic-phonetic compounds. One character chosen for its resemblance in meaning to the Vietnamese word and another for its resemblance in sound were squeezed into an imaginary block to form a new character that identified the Vietnamese morpheme. This practice, combined with the straightforward use of actual Chinese characters for borrowed and some indigenized words, was called </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">chu nom</span><span class="font18"> or “southern writing.”<sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Since Chinese characters are already complex, merging two of them into one unit produced a system so intricate that it had no hope of becoming a tool for popular literacy. The void was filled by a romanized script designed by missionaries and systematized in the mid-seventeenth century. The alphabet’s applications grew as its users expanded. There was no sudden transition to phonetic writing, such as that envisioned by early (and naive) advocates of writing reform in China, Korea, and Japan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Vietnam’s alphabet, which has the misleading name </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">quoc ngu</span><span class="font18"> (“national </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">language'),</span><span class="font18"> was established before the thousands of Western-inspired Sinitic compounds of recent coinage had been absorbed. These terms were introduced gradually through the phonetic writing system, enabling Vietnamese to make whatever adjustments were needed to ensure their intelligibility. Users were not inundated from the start with a lexicon of ambiguous terms. Vietnamese orthography also benefits from the language’s rich inventory of syllable types—four times as many as Mandarin. Words written phonetically thus are more distinct in Vietnamese, with fewer homonyms than in other East Asian languages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;"><span class="font18">Notwithstanding this achievement, Vietnamese continues to divide discourse at the syllable boundary despite the existence of polysyllabic terms, which in most other alphabetic systems appear as units. Although written with a phonemic alphabet, Vietnamese text is segmented at intervals of one to seven letters depending on the (orthographic) length of the syllable. The main vowel is marked with a diacritic for tone. There are historical and psychological reasons, which I shall address presently, why the Vietnamese, like other East Asians, still focus on syllables instead of words. These reasons involve universal constraints on perception and Vietnam’s long cultural and linguistic ties with China. In this respect </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">quoc ngu,</span><span class="font18"> for all its sophistication, still follows the Sinitic paradigm.</span></p>
